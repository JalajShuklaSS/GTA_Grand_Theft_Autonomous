# GTA Grand Theft Autonomous - Mechatronics Project

GTA Grand Theft Autonomous project! This mechatronics endeavor is inspired by the adventurous spirit of Indiana Jones, where our autonomous robot takes on the challenge of locating and swapping a trophy with an ingenious fake counterpart. Notably, our efforts in this college competition earned us a remarkable rank of 2 among 40 participating teams.

## Project Overview
The GTA Grand Theft Autonomous project is a comprehensive mechatronics system designed to tackle the complexities of autonomous navigation, object detection, and precise maneuvers. The key components and features of the project include:

## Autonomous Navigation and Object Manipulation
Our robot showcases adept autonomous self-localization, allowing it to navigate its environment with agility. The primary objective involves locating cylindrical trophies and executing precise maneuvers to pick them up and place them at predefined locations.

## Technology Stack
ESP32-based Control: The project leverages the ESP32 microcontroller for efficient control and communication. The implementation includes PID control algorithms to ensure smooth and accurate movements during trophy handling.

Precision Localization with HTC Vive: For enhanced spatial awareness, we incorporated a precision localization system utilizing HTC Vive technology. This advanced feature elevates the robot's ability to navigate with precision and accuracy.

IR Frequency Detection System: To augment the robot's environmental awareness, we integrated an Infrared (IR) frequency detection system. This system enhances the detection of obstacles and other elements in the robot's vicinity.

Lidar System: The inclusion of a Lidar system further enhances the robot's perception capabilities. Lidar provides detailed, real-time mapping of the surroundings, contributing to more robust obstacle avoidance and navigation.

Wall Following Maneuvers: The robot is equipped with wall-following capabilities, allowing it to navigate along surfaces intelligently. This feature enhances the robot's adaptability to different environments.

Peripheral Components: The project integrates various peripherals, including actuators, display modules, Motor Control Units (MCUs), and other essential components that contribute to the overall functionality of the autonomous robot.

## How It Works
The robot's operation involves a combination of autonomous decision-making, sensor input, and control algorithms. The use of PID control ensures the robot's movements are optimized for grabbing trophies and navigating the environment. Lidar data enhances the robot's spatial awareness, enabling it to make informed decisions about its path.

In addition to basic functionalities, the project incorporates advanced features like precision localization through HTC Vive, wall-following maneuvers, and Lidar-based obstacle avoidance, making the robot versatile in various scenarios.

Project Components
The project encompasses a multidisciplinary approach, involving aspects of design, AutoCAD for mechanical components, PCB design for electronic integration, and the implementation of control algorithms.

## Components:
Mechanical Design: The physical structure of the robot is meticulously designed to facilitate efficient trophy handling and navigation.

AutoCAD: Utilized for detailed design and visualization, AutoCAD plays a crucial role in shaping the mechanical components of the robot.
